                <p>
                    Hello world, my name is Sam! I am currently attending a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp through the University of Washington where I am learning the skills to develop positive user experiences on the web. After graduating the program, I hope to transition my career into web development full-time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 2011, I graduated with a degree in Information Technology. Immediately following graduation, I commissioned into the Army as an officer in the Armor Branch. I spent the next 9.5 years building and leading teams to accomplish whatever mission we were handed. By the time I exited the service in August 2020, I had risen to the rank of Captain. After transitioning from the Army, I took a job as the Maintenance Coordinator for a Johnsonville plant (think sausage) in Momence, IL. After realizing that the manufacturing world is not for me, I decided to pivot my career back to my original interests â€“ the tech world. While the Army provided me many opportunities, my IT skills degraded. I enrolled in the Web Development Bootcamp to relearn my skills and to get up to date with industry best practices.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In my free time I love to get outdoors. Camping, hiking, fishing, kayaking, etc. I like to explore new places and see new sites. My dog, Bear, is my adventure buddy who goes everywhere with me. After completion of the Web Development Bootcamp, I plan to relocate back to, and explore, the great Pacific Northwest! Thanks for stopping by.
