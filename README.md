# Sam Preston - Portfolio

## Description
I am currently working on a Certificate from The University of Washington's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Upon completion of the class I hope to transition my career into web development. As I progress through the class, i will need a place to collect and showcase my work. I will be able to refer future employers to my portfolio in order to view my work and learn about me!

The project was give the following acceptance criteria:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
